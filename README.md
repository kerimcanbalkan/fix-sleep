# Fix Sleep

"Fix Sleep" is an app designed to help you gradually reset your sleep schedule. When you're
ready to make a change, simply enter the time you wake up, and the app will set your alarms 15
minutes earlier each day. This gradual shift helps your body adjust to an earlier routine
without sudden disruptions, allowing you to become a morning person over time. It's a simple,
effective way to improve your sleep habits and reset your internal clock.
